Introduction to Javascript has been brutal! it seemed logical and retainable at first, but now I’ve been putting in countless hours and making little progress. I’ve been re-watching class videos (as much as my crazy schedule allows) and going over the in-class activities, but I still find my self stumped, mainly I don’t know where to start! I need to take advantage of the great support system this progam has. A year to work hard like an Ox and try again tomorrow!

Before doing so, I just want to explain a bit about homework. It asked us to build a password generator. So far I’ve been creating variables, functions and starting to implement event handlers. It is challenging but I’m sure do-able, just need to practice more, a bunch more!

All in all, I found this homework/project to be extremely challenging, spending hours on end figuring out how to start building, writing, and reviewing. However, it was a very educational lesson in being introduced to Javascript and using it to provide functionality to the page.
